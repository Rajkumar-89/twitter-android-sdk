# Twitter SDK for Android

This is an unofficial Java Twitter SDK implementation for Android. It contains a library and sample application project. Currently only supports authentication through a WebView dialog.

## TODO

* Add background image to TwitterActivity to look like a splash screen
* Fix TwitterDialog to not require `StrictMode.enableDefaults;`
* Do all `//TODO`'s
